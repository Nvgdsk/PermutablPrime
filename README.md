# Permute-Prime
Permutable Prime

A permutable prime is a prime number of two or more digits that remains prime with every possible rearrangement of the digits.

For example:
Input: 79
Output: true (79 and 97 are both primes)

Input: 127
Output: false

Input: 337
Output: true (337, 373 and 733 are primes)

Write a program to check if the user input is a permutable prime or not.
